# Let's have some js fun

>In the past, I've made other repositories to try new things or practice some HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Well...I'm sorry to disappoint but if you're looking for any of that you are in the wrong repository. 

>Within this repository, I'll try to use as much js code as possible. I'm a beginner (of course) so, please, I'll ask you to lower your expectations. 

## Variables
### There are 3 types of variables:
1. Booleans = true or false.
2. Numeric
3. Strings = Basically any word or number between "..."

>Variables can sometimes be a pain in the ass because people tend to add multiple variables without purpose. 

Until now, I've learned that there are two ways of calling variables: 

    <!-- On top of code -->
    var x;
    function whatEver () {}
    
    <!--Inside the function -->
    function whatEver () { var x = 1 }
